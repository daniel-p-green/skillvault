# skillvault

Scan it. Trust it. Ship it.

This repo is the public home for **skillvault**: an open-source skill manager for the multi-agent era.

## What is this?

Right now, AI “skills” (instruction packs, tool wrappers, workflows) are being shared like code packages — but without the supply-chain trust layer.

skillvault is intended to provide:
- **Security scanning** for skills (pattern-based + semantic)
- **Format translation** between major agent tools (Claude Code, Cursor, agents.md-style tools, etc.)
- **Versioning + provenance** (git-backed vault)
- **A dashboard** for inventory, scan results, and deployments

## Source brief

See [`MASTER_CONTEXT.md`](./MASTER_CONTEXT.md) for the original project brief and scope.

## Status

Early scaffold. Next steps are being executed via an Antfarm `feature-dev` workflow.
